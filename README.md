One subject, five different movements, four levels of motor imagery data.The sampling rate is 25Hz, a total of 33,000 lines.

With the first letter of Excel, you can distinguish the data of five actions, and the last letter is the grade.For example, d-1-30, which means action d, has a rating of 30%.

It's 33,000 lines at a resolution of 25HZ.That means every 25 lines is 1 second.

The first 20 seconds are the baseline interval (BI), the 20-22 seconds are the ready interval (RI), the 23-24 seconds are the task cue interval (TCI), and the 25-44 seconds are the task interval (TI).There are 30 cycles.
 
 The code is three M files, one is EMD, one is filtering, one is the classification of one of the features, and the other features are similar.
